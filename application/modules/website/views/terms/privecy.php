            <p>We automatically log generic   information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we   call &quot;session data&quot;, that is anonymous and not linked to any personal   information. Session data consists of things such as IP address,   operating system and type of browser software being used and the   activities conducted by the user while on laabus.comsite. An IP   address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such   as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as   the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data   because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are   likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site,   how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long   visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It   also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better   administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any   visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a   visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate   geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
